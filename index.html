<h1>The Learn Enough Story</h1>
<p>
Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach <em>
technical sophistication</em>, the seemingly magical ability to take
command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes
everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts,
Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.
We believe there are <strong>at least a billion people</strong> who
can benefit from learning technical sophistication, probably more. To

<h2>Quotations</h2>

<p>
In addition to hosting most of the world's supply of kitten
videos, the
Web is also full of inspiring quotes, perhaps none more so than
this one:
</p>

<blockquote style="padding: 2px 20px; background: #bab1af;">
<p>
<em>Don't believe every quote you read on the Internet.</em>
<br>â€”Abraham Lincoln</p>

</blockquote>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>
Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is an outgrowth of the
<a target="_blank" href="http://railstutorial.org/" class="image-link">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> and the
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.softcover.io/" class="image-link">Softcover publishing platform</a>.
This page is part of the sample site for
<a target="_blank" href="http://learnenough.com/html-tutorial" class="image-link"><em>Learn Enough HTML to
Be Dangerous</em></a>, which teaches the basics of
<strong>H</strong>yper<strong>T</strong>ext <strong>M</strong>arkup
<strong>L</strong>anguage, the universal language of the World Wide Web.

<p>
HTML was created by the original "web developer", computer scientist
<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee" class="image-link">Tim
Berners-Lee</a>. It's not true that Sir Tim invented HTML in order to
share pictures of his cat, but it would be cool if it were.

<p>
Learn Enough to Be Dangerous was founded in 2015 by Michael Hartl, Lee
Donahoe, and Nick Merwin. We believe that the kind of technical
sophistication taught by the Learn Enough tutorials can benefit
at least a billion people, and probably more.

<p>
Michael is the creator of the <a target="_blank" href="http://railstutorial.org/" class="image-link">
Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> and principal author of the

<a target="_blank" href="http://learnenough.com/" class="image-link">Learn Enough to Be Dangerous</a>
introductory sequence. He is an advanced student of

<a target="_blank" href="http://kravmaga.com/" class="image-link">Krav Maga</a> and has a three-step
plan for world domination. Rumors that he's secretly a supervillain
are slightly exaggerated.

<p>
When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder stashes
on his snowboard, you can find Lee in front of his computer designing
interfaces, doing front-end development, or writing some of the
interface-related Learn Enough tutorials.

<p>
You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy
Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true nerd
at heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code from a
tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.
